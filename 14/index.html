                    <p>Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment setup
                        instructions, they've moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to
                        the

                    <h2>CORE COMPONENTS<sup>Chapter 2</sup></h2>

                    <p>React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using React
                        and
                        the app platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your
                        platform‚Äôs
                        APIs as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components:<span
                            class="italic">
                            bundlesof reusable, nestable code.</span>You can learn more about React in the next section.
                        But
                        first, let‚Äôs
                        cover how components work in React Native.</p>

                <section class="third section" id="third">
                    <h2>REACT FUNDAMENTALS<sup>Chapter3</sup></h2>

                    <p>React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user interfaces
                        with
                        JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section
                        can
                        get you started or can serve as a refresher course.</p>


                    <p>We're going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>


                    <p><span class="bold">+ components</span>The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in its
                        examples: friendly, approachable
                        creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.</p>


                    <p><span class="bold">+ JSX.</span>React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
                        elements
                        inside JavaScript like
                        so: <span class="text"> &lt;Text&gt;Hello, I am your cat!&lt;/Text&gt;</span>.</p>

                    <p>The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more. Because
                        JSX
                        is
                        JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="text">
                            name</span> for the cat, name, and
                        embedding it with curly braces inside <span class="text">&lt;Text&gt;</span> </p>

                    <p><span class="bold">+ props.</span>Props is short for "properties".</p>

                    <p><span class="bold">+ state</span>While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure
                        how
                        components render, state
                        is like a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over
                        time or that comes from user interaction. State gives your components memory!</p>

                <section class="four section" id="four">
                    <h2>HANDLING TEXT INPUT<sup>Chapter 4</sup></h2>

                    <p>TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                            class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that
                        takes a function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that
                        takes a
                        function to be called when the text is submitted.</p>

                    <p>For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a different
                        language. In this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence
                        "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçï üçï".</p>
